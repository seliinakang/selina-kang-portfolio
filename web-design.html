<p class="background-info">For this project, I created a portfolio website for an architect, focusing on translating their unique sensibilities into a compelling digital experience. The process began with in-depth research to understand the designer's field‚Äîbe it Industrial, Graphics, Interactive, or Architecture. I then developed wireframes and mood boards to define the visual direction and layout of the site. The final deliverable was a fully functional website that effectively showcases the designer‚Äôs work, while ensuring a streamlined development process.</p>

    <p><b>The Challenge: </b> Balancing style with an efficient user experience</p>
</div>

<h1 class="headers">RESEARCH</h1>
<p class="research-des">One design element I noticed in his work is the use of lightweight structures and open frameworks, which give his buildings a sense of transparency and lightness, making it very experimental. He uses lots of natural materials in his designs like wood and glass, which builds a relationship between the natural world and the constructed environment. Additionally, the ideas of transparency, layering, and modularity are commonly explored in his works. His structures frequently have complex spatial layouts, where many volumes and levels overlap and interact.</p>

<h1 class="headers">ITERATIVE PROCESS</h1>
<p class="iterative-process-des">My objective was to create a simple website to make navigation as easy as possible while following the general design aesthetic of the actual artist himself. I shifted towards refining the placement of essential elements intended for consistency across all pages. I iterated on the design concepts based on feedback from users, focusing on enhancing usability, accessibility, and overall user satisfaction. Each iteration brought me closer to achieving the vision of a seamless and engaging user experience. </p>

<h1 class="headers">DESIGN FEATURES</h1>
<ul class="features-des">
    <li><b>Home Page</b> - Features a curated selection of the architect's most notable projects, presented through a visually engaging hero area with high-quality images. The layout highlights standout works and includes interactive elements to enhance user engagement, providing an impactful introduction to the architect's portfolio.</li>
    <li><b>Projects</b> - Each image was linked to their corresponding projects, with name, location, year, and a short description. After making all project pages, I added arrows on each page for the user to cycle through all the projects. The user can then scroll through various images of that particular architect‚Äôs work.</li>
    <li><b>About & Contact</b> - Developing the 'About' and 'Contact' pages involved a structured approach aimed at maintaining consistency across the website. I began by focusing on aligning the headers identically to establish a cohesive visual identity. With the framework set, I organized the content, including paragraphs and images, adhering closely to the predefined margin guidelines implemented across all pages. This  attention to detail not only ensures a seamless user experience but also reinforces the overarching design aesthetic, creating a cohesive portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="headers">VISUAL ANALYSIS</h1>
<img class="visual-analysis-img" src="public/imgs/visual-analysis.png">

<h1 class="headers">FEEDBACK SESSIONS</h1>
<p class="feedback-des">Throughout the development of this portfolio, I engaged in multiple rounds of feedback sessions, which provided invaluable insights and suggestions, including:</p>
<ul class="features-des">
    <li><b>Footer Addition</b> - Feedback suggested adding a footer. The implemented footer includes shortcuts to all pages, a "copyright" section, and a recruitment email subscription section.</li>
    <li><b>Navigation Bar</b> - Consider keeping the navigation bar fixed, as the unique menu icon is a significant feature of the site.</li>
    <li><b>Menu Icon Color Changes</b> - Implemented color changes for menu icon squares based on cursor location and the designer‚Äôs aesthetic.</li>
    <li><b>Hover Animation in Projects Menu</b> - The on-hover animation for project names was deemed unnecessary; changed to a hover effect that enlarges images instead.</li>
    <li><b>Intersection Observer</b> - Introduced to manage animations and lazy-loading of images, improving website performance and responsiveness. Replaced previous moving-down intro animation which caused conflicts with CSS code.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="headers">RESULTS</h1>
<p class="results-des">The final result of this project is a fully functional portfolio website that effectively embodies the designer‚Äôs unique sensibilities and showcases their work in a compelling digital format. The site is built upon thorough research into the designer‚Äôs field, ensuring that the visual direction and layout resonate with their professional identity.</p>

<h1 class="headers">TAKEAWAYS</h1>
<h1 class="takeaway-titles">Steep Learning Curve and Skill Enhancement</h1>
<p class="takeaway-des">This project was both enjoyable and challenging, pushing me to expand my web development knowledge and proficiency. It was the most rewarding of the three projects I‚Äôve worked on so far, largely due to the freedom it offered in design and the opportunity to deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h1 class="takeaway-titles">Valuable Feedback Loop</h1>
<p class="takeaway-des">I actively sought input from a diverse group of people during the development process. Their feedback was crucial in distinguishing between poorly and well-designed web portfolios, helping me to refine the website's user experience and make more informed design decisions.</p>

<h1 class="headers">LOOKING FORWARD</h1>
<p class="takeaway-des">Designing and coding a portfolio for Sou Fujimoto was an insightful experience that allowed me to deeply understand and incorporate another designer‚Äôs unique style. Fujimoto‚Äôs approach of blending natural forms with architectural innovation helped me step out of my comfort zone and look at design from a new perspective. Adapting my own style to reflect his vision authentically taught me a lot about analyzing and incorporating different design philosophies into my work.</p>
<p class="takeaway-des">Looking forward, I am excited to take this experience into future projects, further exploring how different design styles can inform and inspire my work. I aim to continue pushing my creative boundaries, fostering a deeper connection between form, function, and individuality in my designs.</p>
