<p class="background">Whose Land is an educational app designed to map Indigenous territories and enhance cultural understanding. It transforms how users engage with Indigenous lands by providing an interactive map and valuable educational resources.</p>
<p class="background-info">The app's core mission is to empower users with clear, accessible information and comprehensive insights into Indigenous communities, fostering deeper connections and respect for Indigenous histories and cultures.</p>

<h1 class="headers">PROBLEMS</h1>
<p class="problems-des">Users exploring Indigenous territories may face challenges due to unclear and inaccessible information about specific communities nearby.</p>
<p class="problems-des-2">This can create stress and difficulty when trying to engage with Indigenous lands and cultures digitally. Clear guidelines and accessible information are crucial to improving the user experience, enabling meaningful interaction with Indigenous histories and territories.</p>

<h1 class="headers">GOALS</h1>
<p class="goals-des">I want to pinpoint the main challenges users face with the Whose Land app in finding information about Indigenous territories and communities. Understanding these issues will guide the creation of a tool to enhance user comfort and usability. This new feature will seamlessly integrate into the app's original design, focusing on improving navigation, access to Indigenous knowledge, and overall user experience when exploring Indigenous cultures and histories.</p>

<h1 class="headers">USABILITY TESTING ON CURRENT WHOSE LAND APP</h1>
<p class="usability-testing-des">Usability testing of the current application aims to understand how users interact with it and identify any pain points they experience. 4 users participated in this test. For this test, I prepared 3 tasks for users to complete. These tasks include:</p>
<div class="usability-box-1">
  <p>Discover how to build your own land acknowledgements</p>
</div>
<div class="usability-box-2">
  <p>Find out more information about Musqueam First Nation</p>
</div>
<div class="usability-box-3">
  <p>Locate all Indigenous communities in Northwest Territories</p>
</div>
<h1 class="headers">USABILITY TESTING RESULTS</h1>
<img class="usability-testing-results-img" src="public/imgs/WhoseLandTestResults.png">
<p class="testing-results">Task 1 was almost completely unsuccessful, however one users results were inconclusive. This is because "the Building Acknowledgements button just leads to the Learning section and it just seems unnecessary". In Task 2, users completed the task using the search engine, but they had trouble locating it and found it by process of elimination. Task 3 was 75% successful. The user who didn‚Äôt complete the task said it was because they weren‚Äôt sure where the Northwest Territories were.</p>

<h1 class="headers">ADDRESSING ISSUE #1</h1>
<h1 class="issue-1">How can I structure the app's content in a way that makes sense to users?</h1>
<p class="issue-1-des">To address the needs of the user, a card sorting was performed with 2 users. It helps match the app‚Äôs layout with how users naturally group and label information and improves navigation by placing categories logically.</p>
<img class="card-sort" src="public/imgs/WhoseLandCardSort.png">
<p class="card-sort-des">Given this, I want to simplify the experience by making the menu and categories more clear so users can find what they need quickly. As well, I can place sub-categories in more logical, easily accessible locations.</p>

<h1 class="headers">SOLVING ISSUE #1</h1>
<img class="nav-map-img" src="public/imgs/WhoseLandNavMap.png">

<h1 class="headers">ADDRESSING ISSUE #2</h1>
<h1 class="issue-1">How might we simplify the mapping experience so that users can locate information more quickly and easily?</h1>
<p class="issue-1-des">Why are users having difficulty finding information more quickly?</p>
<ul class="issue-2-list">
    <li>Map labels may be hard to read or not descriptive enough</li>
    <li>Colors used on the map might be crowding or difficult to distinguish</li>
    <li>Zooming and panning may be slow, making it hard to explore</li>
    <li>The layout and symbols may not be intuitive or user-friendly.</li>
